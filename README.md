# Regression_Models_Project

We Look at a data set of a collection of cars (mtcars), we are interested in exploring the relationship between
a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). we are particularly interested in the following two
questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?” 

“Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”

The variables included in this dataset are:

• mpg : Miles/(US) gallon

• cyl : Number of cylinders

• disp : Displacement (cu.in.)

• hp : Gross horsepower

• drat : Rear axle ratio

• wt : Weight (1000 lbs)

• qsec : 1/4 mile time

• vs : Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)

• am : Transmission (0 = automatic,
